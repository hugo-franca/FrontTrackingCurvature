# FrontTrackingCurvature
 Sample code for Front-Tracking curvature estimation with Machine Learning

# Requirements to run these examples
 In order to run these examples, you will need an installation of Python. The examples were last tested on Python version 3.8.5, but they will likely work or other versions somewhat near this one as well.

 Below, we list the five python modules you will need to install in order to run the examples. Below each module, we list the python command you can use to install it, and also the version of that module that we last tested the examples with. Once again, they will probably work with other versions as well.

 Module NUMPY: 1.21.4
	python -m pip install numpy

 Module Matplotlib: 3.5.0
 python -m pip install matplotlib

 Module Pandas: 1.3.4
 python -m pip install pandas

 Module Tensorflow: 2.7.0
 python -m pip install tensorflow

 Module scipy: 1.7.2
 python -m pip install scipy
